# xG-model

I create an expected goals (xG) model, then try to improve it by adding features. I compare how well the model fits using different subsets of the features and using different models (XGBoost vs Neural Net). The final model looks pretty good in the end and compares well to, for example, https://understat.com/.
The datasets I use can be found at

and

and are too big to upload here.
